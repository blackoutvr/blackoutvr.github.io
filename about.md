## What is Sight Unseen?

_Sight Unseen_ is an immersive VR audiogame set to be released on PC and Mac OS in late 2016. It uses the latest in 3D audio and geometric modeling technology to create a rich, detailed 3D soundscape that players can explore through sound alone. All you need is a pair of headphones and a willingness to jump into a new kind of game experience. Any pair of headphones will do, and sighted players have the option of using a minimalist UI that can be useful in helping those uninitiated in the world of audiogames to adapt to a lack of visuals.  

Should you choose to embrace this challenge, you’ll find yourself in a mysterious and terrifying world with only your ears and intuition to help you escape. Good luck. 

## Who is this game for?

Everyone. Our goal isn’t just to make a game for the visually impaired community, but to create a game that everyone can enjoy, regardless of sight. We’re striving toward one unified community that can come together and share this experience.

## Who are we?

We’re a group of like-minded developers and designers who believe in the power of virtual presence. Most of us met in Rochester, New York, but we’ve since spread out to the corners of the Earth. You can find more info on the team that made this happen below.
